This is a 2d minecraft-like game written for [CHDK](https://chdk.fandom.com/wiki/CHDK).

I wrote it in Lua back in 2016, and it is among the first few programs I ever wrote. Because of this, the code is probably quite inefficient. I'll probably rewrite in C, using the libraries provided by CHDK for better performance.

This was only tested on a Canon PowerShot A2200, and uses keybindings suited for that camera.
